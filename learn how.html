    <h1>The Importance of learning to save</h1>
    <p>
There is a lot to benefit from a savings account other than merely earning interest from the savings. Saving money will help you build up funds to cover both planned and unexpected expenses in the future.
Whether you are saving towards a set goal or you are saving for a rainy day, there are three savings needs and requirements to consider:

-The interest rate you are offered (is it a fixed or variable rate)
-The pattern of deposits to your savings account
-Easy access savings accounts

When choosing a savings account, it is best to consider these factors.

<h2>The interest rate offered</h2>
Financial institutions always charge you interest when you take out a loan, similarly, you also earn interest on the money you save.

You can be offered a fixed or variable interest rate; the best choice depends on your circumstances/ preferences.
