    <br>
    <br>
There is a lot to benefit from a savings account other than merely earning interest from the savings. Saving money will help you build up funds to cover both planned and unexpected expenses in the future.
Whether you are saving towards a set goal or you are saving for a rainy day, there are three savings needs and requirements to consider:
<ul>
<li>
The interest rate you are offered (is it a fixed or variable rate)
</li>
<li>
The pattern of deposits to your savings account
</li>
<li>
Easy access savings accounts
</li>
<br>When choosing a savings account, it is best to consider these factors.

</ul>
<h2>The interest rate offered</h2>
Financial institutions always charge you interest when you take out a loan, similarly, you also earn interest on the money you save.
You can be offered a fixed or variable interest rate; the best choice depends on your circumstances/ preferences.

<h2>
Variable interest rate
</h2>
A variable interest rate is subject to change over time since it is influenced by the repo rate (set by the South African Reserve Bank). Taking a savings account with a variable interest rate means you earn more interest when the country interest rates go up and earn less when the rate is low.

This means, interest being earned on savings accounts is currently low; also interest being paid on loans is low.

Therefore if you have a savings account with a variable interest rate, you'll earn more interest if the interest rate goes up, and less if it goes down.

<h2>
Fixed interest rate
</h2>
A fixed interest rate doesn't change at any point in your savings because it is not affected by the repo rate.
The interest rate you are offered when signing the savings agreement does not change at any point.
In a case where the repo rate goes up, you doesn't get any relative increase on your earnings just as you will not earn less when the repo rate goes down.
Even though you might miss out when the repo rate goes up, a fixed interest rate is less risky.
Mostly savings accounts have compounding interest, which makes you earn more interest as the time goes on.
With the compound interest, earning is accumulated on the original amount you saved plus the interest already accumulated.
While simple interest accumulates money only on the original amount you saved, therefore it is not as good as earning compound interest.

<h2>
Deposits to your savings account
</h2>
After opening a savings account, the way you are going to deposit money in it utterly depends on your circumstance.

There are two options to fund your savings account, regular deposits or once-off deposits with a lump sum.

<h3>
Regular deposits
</h3>
Most people opt to fund their savings accounts with regular deposits by making monthly debit orders.
This is a manageable option since you don't need more to start saving.

<h3>
Once off deposits
</h3>
This is the best option because you fund your savings account with a lump sum amount and immediately start earning interest from it. Rather than depositing monthly small amounts that will take long to grow.

<h2>
Easy access savings accounts
</h2>
These are accounts that pay interest and allow you to withdraw money whenever you need it.
If you are saving for a rainy day, you might prefer a savings account that will allow you to withdraw funds in the shortest time possible whenever the need arises.
Remember rainy days come without anticipation and to address some of them you need to get cash in the shortest time possible.
Therefore if your funds are meant for rainy days, then a savings account that allows anytime withdrawals might be a good option.
